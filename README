WP-Flex is a responsive wordpress framework combining @Media Queries, Modernizr and some bobs and bits from Twitter's Bootstrap.  

Start with a great foundation that includes the best of the best boilerplate ideas out there including HTML5 Boilerplate, Jon Korpi's Golden Grid System and Twitter Bootstrap.

There are many other Blank Wordpress Theme Frameworks by really smart folks smarter than myself and they are:

1. Matt Murtaugh's HTML5 Reset Wordpress Theme

2. Digging Into Wordpress' BLANK Wordpress Theme

Surely you can always visit the Wordpress Codex for more customization and give it a shot yourself -thats what I did :)p
